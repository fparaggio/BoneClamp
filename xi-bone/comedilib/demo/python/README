I wrote the python scripts using Bryan Cole's comedi wrappers.  I
followed the instructions provided by him to generate the comedi
python module.

I then produced the three following scripts:

info.py:

	This script emulates the comedilib/demo/info program

cmd.py:

	This script emulates the comedilib/demo/cmd program

mmap.py:

	This script emulates the comedilib/demo/mmap program with the
	added twist that the output is saved to a binary log file.
	This file can be accessed using a variety of means including a
	sample octave script <stream_readme3.m> which is provided.

As usual, comments are always welcome.
