Comedi SCXI Documentation - Caleb Tennis (caleb@aei-tech.com)

SCXI is a National Instruments standard for signal conditioning.  It encompasses a set of
hardware that has the capability of reading and writing multiple types of channels via a
regular data acqusition card.

A SCXI system consists of a chassis with one or more SCXI modules located inside.  The system
is connected via a cable to the data acquisition system, which communicates with the modules.

Comedi's SCXI support is available in a library, which will be built alongside the regular comedilib
if the --enable-scxi option is passed during ./configure time



The following functions are available:


scxi_mod_t *comedi_scxi_open(comedi_t *dev, unsigned short chassis_address, unsigned short mod_slot)

This function initializes the scxi module within a certain chassis and slot.  Returns a pointer
to a scxi_module_struct which contains all of the pertinent information about the SCXI module.  It
also attempts to figure out which module is located in the slot based on the information returned
from the module.



void comedi_scxi_close(scxi_mod_t *)

Closes the SCXI module



int comedi_scxi_register_readwrite(scxi_mod_t *mod, unsigned short reg_address, 
				unsigned int num_bytes, unsigned char *data_out, unsigned char *data_in)
			 
This is the low level function for communicating with the SCXI module.  It reads/writes the data
in/out of the register.
