Function: comedi_dio_bitfield -- read/write multiple digital channels
Retval: int
Param: comedi_t * device
Param: unsigned int subdevice
Param: unsigned int write_mask
Param: unsigned int * bits
Status: deprecated
Description:
 This function is deprecated.  Use comedi_dio_bitfield2() instead.

Function: comedi_from_phys -- convert physical units to sample
Retval: lsampl_t
Param: double data
Param: comedi_range * range
Param: lsampl_t maxdata
Status: deprecated
Description:
 Converts data given in physical units (data) into sample values
 (lsampl_t, between 0 and maxdata).  The parameter rng
 represents the conversion information to use, and the parameter
 maxdata represents the maximum possible data value for the
 channel that the data will be written to.

 Conversion is not affected by out-of-range behavior.  Out-of-range
 data parameters are silently truncated to the range 0 to maxdata.

Function: comedi_get_timer -- timer information (deprecated)
Retval: int
Param: comedi_t * device
Param: unsigned int subdevice
Param: double frequency
Param: unsigned int * trigvar
Param: double * actual_frequency
Status: deprecated
Description:
 The function comedi_get_timer converts the frequency frequency
 to a number suitable to send to the driver in a comedi_trig
 structure.  This function remains for compatibility with very
 old versions of Comedi, that converted sampling rates to timer
 values in the libary.  This conversion is now done in the kernel,
 and every device has the timer type nanosec_timer, indicating
 that timer values are simply a time specified in nanoseconds.

Function: comedi_set_global_oor_behavior -- out-of-range behavior
Retval: int
Param: enum comedi_oor_behavior behavior
Status: deprecated
Description:
 This function changes the Comedilib out-of-range behavior.
 This currently affects the behavior of comedi_to_phys() when
 converting endpoint sample values, that is, sample values
 equal to 0 or maxdata.  If the out-of-range behavior is set to
 COMEDI_OOR_NAN, endpoint values are converted to NAN.  If the
 out-of-range behavior is set to COMEDI_OOR_NUMBER, the endpoint
 values are converted similarly to other values.

 The previous out-of-range behavior is returned.

Function: comedi_sv_init -- slowly-varying inputs
Retval: int
Param: comedi_sv_t * sv
Param: comedi_t * device
Param: unsigned int subdevice
Param: unsigned int channel
Status: deprecated
Description:
 The function comedi_sv_init() initializes the slow varying Comedi
 structure sv to use the device device, the analog input subdevice
 subdevice, and the channel channel.  The slow varying Comedi
 structure is used by comedi_sv_measure() to accurately measure
 an analog input by averaging over many samples.  The default
 number of samples is 100.  This function returns 0 on success,
 -1 on error.

Function: comedi_sv_measure -- slowly-varying inputs
Retval: int
Param: comedi_sv_t * sv
Param: double * data
Status: deprecated
Description:
 The function comedi_sv_measure() uses the slowly varying Comedi
 structure sv to measure a slowly varying signal.  If successful,
 the result (in physical units) is stored in the location pointed
 to by data, and the number of samples is returned.  On error, -1
 is returned.

Function: comedi_sv_update -- slowly-varying inputs
Retval: int
Param: comedi_sv_t * sv
Status: deprecated
Description:
 The function comedi_sv_update() updates internal parameters of
 the slowly varying Comedi structure sv.

Function: comedi_timed_1chan -- streaming input (deprecated)
Retval: int
Param: comedi_t * device
Param: unsigned int subdevice
Param: unsigned int channel
Param: unsigned int range
Param: unsigned int aref
Param: double frequency
Param: unsigned int num_samples
Param: double * data
Status: deprecated
Description:
 Not documented.

Function: comedi_to_phys -- convert sample to physical units
Retval: double
Param: lsampl_t data
Param: comedi_range * range
Param: lsampl_t maxdata
Status: deprecated
Description:
 Converts data given in sample values (lsampl_t, between 0 and
 maxdata) into physical units (double).  The parameter range
 represents the conversion information to use, and the parameter
 maxdata represents the maximum possible data value for the
 channel that the data was read.

 Conversion of endpoint sample values, that is, sample values
 equal to 0 or maxdata, is affected by the Comedilib out-of-range
 behavior.  If the out-of-range behavior is set to COMEDI_OOR_NAN,
 endpoint values are converted to NAN.  If the out-of-range
 behavior is set to COMEDI_OOR_NUMBER, the endpoint values are
 converted similarly to other values.

 If there is an error, NAN is returned.

Function: comedi_trigger -- perform streaming input/output (deprecated)
Retval: int
Param: comedi_t * device
Param: comedi_trig * trig
Status: deprecated
Description:
 The function comedi_trigger() instructs Comedi to
 perform the command specified by the trigger structure trig.
 The return value depends on
 the particular trig being issued.  If there is an
 error, -1 is returned.
