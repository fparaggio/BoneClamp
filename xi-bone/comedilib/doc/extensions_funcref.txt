Status: alpha
Description:
 This function queries the master clock for a subdevice, as
 set by

 The currently configured gate source
 will be written to *<parameter>gate_source</parameter>.
 The possible values and their corresponding gates are

	The term "hardware buffer" refers to any fifos, etc. on the acquisition board itself which
	are used during streaming commands.  This does not include the buffer maintained by
	the comedi kernel module in host memory, whose size may be queried by
	<link linkend="func-ref-comedi-get-buffer-size"><function>comedi_get_buffer_size</function></link>.
	The <parameter>direction</parameter> parameter of type
	<link linkend="ref-enum-comedi-io-direction">enum comedi_io_direction</link>
	should be set to COMEDI_INPUT to query the input buffer size (e.g., the buffer of an analog
	input subdevice), or COMEDI_OUTPUT to query the output buffer size (e.g., the buffer of
	an analog output).
Returns:
	Number of bytes, or -1 on error.

Function: comedi_set_clock_source -- set master clock for a subdevice
Retval: int
Param: comedi_t * device
Param: unsigned int subdevice
Param: unsigned int clock
Param: unsigned int period_ns
Status: alpha
Description:
 This function selects a master clock for a subdevice.  The <parameter>clock</parameter>
 parameter selects the master clock, and is driver-dependant.  The <parameter>period_ns</parameter>
 parameter specifies the clock's period in nanoseconds.  It may left unspecified by using
 a value of zero.  Drivers will ignore the clock period if they already
 know what the clock period should be for the specified clock (i.e. for an
 on-board 20MHz oscillator).  Certain boards which use a phase-locked loop to
 synchronize to external clock sources must be told the frequency of the external
 clock. Specifying a clock period for an external clock may also allow
 the driver to support TRIG_TIMER sources in commands while
 using the external clock.

 The clock may be queried with the <link linkend="func-ref-comedi-get-clock-source">comedi_get_clock_source()</link>
 function.

 This function is only useable
 on subdevices that provide support for the INSN_CONFIG_SET_CLOCK_SOURCE
 configuration instruction.

Function: comedi_set_counter_mode -- change mode of a counter subdevice
Retval: int
Param: comedi_t * device
Param: unsigned int subdevice
Param: unsigned int channel
Param: unsigned int mode
Status: alpha
Description:
 This function configures a counter subdevice.  The meaning of the
 <parameter>mode</parameter> parameter is driver-dependent.
 If the subdevice does not
 support configuring its mode on a per-channel basis, then the
 <parameter>channel</parameter>
 parameter will be ignored.

 It is only useable
 on subdevices that provide support for the INSN_CONFIG_SET_COUNTER_MODE
 configuration instruction.
Returns:
 0 on success, -1 on error.

Function: comedi_set_filter -- select a filter for a subdevice
Retval: int
Param: comedi_t * device
Param: unsigned int subdevice
Param: unsigned int channel
Param: unsigned int filter
Status: alpha
Description:
 This function selects a filter for a subdevice.  For instance, a digital
 input subdevice may provide deglitching filters with varying cutoff frequencies.
 The filters are used to prevent high-frequency
 noise from causing unwanted transitions on the digital inputs.  This function can
 tell the hardware which deglitching filter to use, or to use none at all.

 The <parameter>filter</parameter>
 parameter selects which of the subdevice's filters to use, and is driver-dependant.

 This function is only useable
 on subdevices that provide support for the INSN_CONFIG_FILTER
 configuration instruction.
Returns:
 0 on success, -1 on error.

Function: comedi_set_gate_source -- select gate source for a subdevice
Retval: int
Param: comedi_t * device
Param: unsigned int subdevice
Param: unsigned int channel
Param: unsigned int gate_index
Param: unsigned int gate_source
Status: alpha
Description:
 This function selects a gate source for a subdevice.  The <parameter>gate_index</parameter>
 parameter selects which gate is being configured, should the subdevice have
 multiple gates.  It takes a value
 from 0 to N-1 for a subdevice with N different gates.
 The <parameter>gate_source</parameter> parameter selects which signal you wish to
 use as
 the gate, and is also driver-dependent.  If the subdevice does not
 support configuring its gates on a per-channel basis, then the
 <parameter>channel</parameter> parameter will be ignored.

 You may query the gate source with the <link linkend="func-ref-comedi-get-gate-source">comedi_get_gate_source()</link>
 function.
 This function is only useable
 on subdevices that provide support for the INSN_CONFIG_SET_GATE_SOURCE
 configuration instruction.

 0 on success, -1 on error.

Function: comedi_set_other_source -- select source signal for something other than a gate or clock
Retval: int
Param: comedi_t * device
Param: unsigned int subdevice
Param: unsigned int channel
Param: unsigned int other
Param: unsigned int source
Status: alpha
Description:
 This function allows selection of a source signal for something on a subdevice
 other than a gate (which uses comedi_set_gate_source()) or a clock (which uses
 comedi_set_clock_source()).  The <parameter>other</parameter> parameter selects
 which "other" we are configuring, and is driver-dependent.  The
 <parameter>source</parameter> selects the source we which to use for the
 "other".  If the subdevice does not
 support configuring its "other" sources on a per-channel basis, then the
 <parameter>channel</parameter>
 parameter will be ignored.

 As an example, this function is used to select which PFI digital input channels
 should be used as the A/B/Z signals when running a counter on an NI M-Series board as
 a quadrature encoder.  The <parameter>other</parameter> parameter selects either the A, B,
 or Z signal, and the <parameter>source</parameter> parameter is used to specify
 which PFI digital input channel the external A, B, or Z signal is
 physically connected to.

 This function is only useable
 on subdevices that provide support for the INSN_CONFIG_SET_OTHER_SOURCE
 configuration instruction.
Returns:
 0 on success, -1 on error.

Param: unsigned int routing
Status: alpha
Description:
 This function configures a mutiplexed output channel which can
 output a variety of different signals (such as NI's RTSI and PFI lines).
 The <parameter>routing</parameter>
 parameter selects which signal should be routed to appear on the
 selected output channel, and is driver-dependant.

 The routing may be queried with the
 <link linkend="func-ref-comedi-get-routing">comedi_get_routing()</link> function.
 This function is only useable
 on subdevices that provide support for the INSN_CONFIG_SET_ROUTING
 configuration instruction.
Returns:
 0 on success, -1 on error.
