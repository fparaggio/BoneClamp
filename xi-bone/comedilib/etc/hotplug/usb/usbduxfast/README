Remarks to the hotplug script "usbduxfast":
---------------------------------------

The script /etc/hotplug/usb/usbduxfast uploads the
firmware into the usb device after it has been
plugged in.

It assumes that you have installed the firmware
under /usr/share/usb (recommended by the usb hotplug team) and that
usbdux shall be connected to comedi0.

Please modify the script if needed.



To compile the firmware:
------------------------
Download the as31 from:

http://www.berndporr.me.uk/as31/

(this is a patched version of as31 which supports an
include directive).

Install it in this directory.

Then run "make -f Makefile_asm".
