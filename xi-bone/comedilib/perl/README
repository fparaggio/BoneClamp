Comedi and Comedi::Lib: A Perl API for comedi and comedilib

Version 0.02 16-Nov-1999

This is a first pass at a Perl extension for using comedi and comedilib
(http://www.comedi.org/comedi).

This is also my first attempt at a Perl extension, so be warned!  I
started with h2xs and hacked away at it from there.  Please pass the
clues if you're an XS wizard.

There are some example scripts but no tests (yet).  You can run the
examples before actually installing the modules (make install) using
the little script 'lperl', e.g.,

  [jes@rtc Comedi]$ ./lperl example.perl

The modules and examples were tested with comedi 0.7.{19,26} and
comedilib 0.7.{3,5,6}, using an NI-MIO-16e.  There should be no
board-specific stuff here (except possibly the subdevice codes);
please let me know if it (does|doesn't) work with other boards.

There is very little object oriented code here, and what is here (a
Trigger object) need not be used.  Right now, I'm not anxious to add
another layer over comedi, which is still alpha.  Any ideas or
suggestions are welcome, however.
