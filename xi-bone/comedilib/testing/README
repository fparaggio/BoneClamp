The results directory contains last-known testing results that have
been contributed by users.  If your board is listed there,
please compare it the output of comedi_test and if it differs
significantly, send me a copy and/or diff.  I'll either update
the file, or it indicates that there is a bug.  If your board
is not listed here, send me a copy of the output so it can
be included.

comedi_test tends to create a lot of output.  The important
information has lines beginning with either I:, W:, or E:,
indicating information, warning, or error, respectively.
You can grep for this information using the regexp '^.:'.
Errors are usually problems that need to be fixed, but are
not necessarily significant bugs.  Warnings need to be
audited by ds to know whether or not they are significant,
since comedi_test isn't very smart about some checks.  (That's
why they're warnings and not errors.)
