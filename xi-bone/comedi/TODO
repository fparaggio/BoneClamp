bug: buffer resize to 0 convinces comedi that buffer doesn't exist

doc: how to use kcomedilib

comedi_rt_timer segfaults when the lower-level driver disappears
and reappears.  This is a problem with the Comedi core, not the
driver.  I don't really know how to fix this.  Actually, I do.
kcomedilib needs an implementation of comedi_open() and comedi_close().

das6402 needs cleanup

fix PCI code, use pci_find_device()

pci_enable_device() needs to be added to many drivers

get rid of spurious "char-major-98-0 not found"

spinlocks

autoloading causes BUG on failure.

das1800: kmalloc could fail on large buffer sizes (see dt282x).  Needs
to be fixed to use a bounce buffer.

move /proc/comedi to /proc/driver/comedi

Drivers that do DMA need to be fixed for big-endian machines.

ni_pcimio: doesn't do DMA with AO

ni_pcimio: ai COMEDI_WAKE_EOS doesn't work with DMA

create separate fops structure for unconfigured devices (probably not)

ni_mio_common: resetting AO sets ao chan 1 to -10V

Dan Christian 07/01: rtd520.o: problems with buffer

ni_pcimio: polling

migrate COMEDI_CB interface to COMEDI_EV flags, move #defines to comedidev.h

rename prealloc_buf and prealloc_bufsz

fix RT interrupts and comedi_irq[] dumbness

ni_mio_common: analog output doesn't work correctly with insns after
  running a command
