1. I get the error message:

  Makefile:14: /usr/src/linux/.config: No such file or directory
  make: *** No rule to make target `/usr/src/linux/.config'.  Stop.

It means you don't have the file /usr/src/linux/.config.  This file
contains all the configuration information about your linux kernel,
which comedi needs in order to compile correctly.  Some distributions
don't contain this file, so you will need to create your own, by
compiling your own kernel.  This file is automatically created
when you run 'make config', the first step in compiling a kernel.


2. I'm using Red Hat 7.x and it doesn't work...

Red Hat kernels are not supported because they are too heavily
modified.  The recommended solution is to download pristine kernel
sources from kernel.org and compile a new kernel, then compile
Comedi with that new kernel.  Alternatively, there are a few notes
in Documentation/comedi/redhat-notes from users that have
successfully used Red Hat kernels.


3. Compilation fails with the error message:

  comedi_fops.c:1749: too few arguments to function
  `kill_fasync_Rsmpd2040200'

See #2.
