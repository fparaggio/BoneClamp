A list of some of the hacks in the low-level drivers.  If
you want to use a hack in a different driver, please fix the
hack instead of duplicating it.


- Extended configuration:  the daqboard2000 driver loads about
  40 kB of FPGA programming information at device configuration.
  It does this by overloading option[0] and option[1] with the
  address and length of the programming data.  A corresponding
  hack in comedi_config allows one to specify a file to be loaded
  as the FPGA data.  Fix:  change the devconfig interface to
  make this standard.

- Autocalibration input:  the ni_mio_common driver uses AREF_OTHER
  to access stable voltage references on the board.  It's not the
  best method, but it is only supposed to be accessed by
  comedi_calibrate.
